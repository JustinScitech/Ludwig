## Developing THE BEST robot that can play music for you
Made by: Justin, Jonny, Sanjay, and Christian

## We'll update more about this repo later, but here's the entire tech involved
```
Software: Python3 with OpenCV
```

```
Hardware: Raspberry Pi3 with a bunch of Servomotors and a servomotor module.
```
